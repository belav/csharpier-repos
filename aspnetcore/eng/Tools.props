      This is here to workaround flakiness in the NuGet SDK resolver in MSBuild. Arcade will run a pre-restore for
      these packages. This works more consistently than the SDK resolution which uses global.json. Without this
      here, we see regular failures with 'error MSB4236: The SDK 'Yarn.MSBuild' specified could not be found.'
      Since this project is evaluated before .npmproj files are loaded, this should cause the package to end up in
      the NuGet cache ahead of time. This is not needed in source build.
